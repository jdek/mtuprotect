**MTUProtect: Because Your VPN Shouldn't Be the Most Chaotic Thing in Your Life**

- ISP still clinging to DS-Lite like trauma you keep pretending doesn't affect you?
- Company forcing you to use GlobalProtect because capitalism breeds bad software?
- Stuck with macOS because you've gone too far to admit WSL might actually work?
- TCP connections ghosted harder than your Grindr date who 'just wanted to network'?
- Packets cut shorter than a UdK student's bangs during this week's identity crisis?

**Introducing MTUProtect!**

A tiny script that yells, 'Why the fuck isn't there a setting for this?'---because you have better things to do than hand-edit your MTU every time your VPN tries to gaslight you.

**Features**

- ✅ Monitors your VPN connection so you can go back to reading Nietzsche.
- ✅ Automatically sets the MTU to 1280 (it's my star sign).
- ✅ Only works on macOS (not like you're paying for the hardware).
- ✅ Saves you countless hours of debugging you would waste anyway.
- ✅ Absolutely will not fix your other issues.

**Installation**

- `make`
- `sudo make install`
- `sudo launchctl start il.luminati.mtuprotect`
- Pretend this is a permanent fix.
